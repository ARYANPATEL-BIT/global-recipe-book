## 📝 Description
Feijoada is Brazil’s most beloved national dish — a hearty black bean stew simmered with smoked and salted pork, sausages, and spices.  
Originally a dish of resourcefulness, it blends flavors from Indigenous, African and Portuguese traditions.  
Serve it in generous portions with white rice, sautéed collard greens (*couve*), orange slices, and **farofa** (toasted cassava flour).

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Soak the beans:** Rinse the black beans and soak them for 6–8 hours or overnight. Drain before cooking.  
2. **Prepare the salted pork:** If using salted meat, parboil for 10 minutes, discard the water, rinse and set aside.  
3. **Brown the meats:** Heat oil in a large pot, brown the pork shoulder and ribs. Remove and set aside.  
4. **Sauté the aromatics:** Add onion and cook until translucent. Add garlic and smoked paprika.  
5. **Simmer:** Return meats to the pot, add beans, bay leaves, and enough water or stock to cover. Simmer gently for 2–3 hours.  
6. **Add the sausages:** 30 minutes before finishing, add the sausages so they heat through.  
7. **Adjust the texture:** Mash a few beans against the pot side to thicken; season with salt and black pepper.  
8. **Serve:** Let it rest for 15 minutes before serving with rice, sautéed kale, oranges, and farofa.
